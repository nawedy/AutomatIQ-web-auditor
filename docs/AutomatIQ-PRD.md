## **1. Proposal for the Website Audit Tool**

A strong proposal outlines the problem, your solution, and the benefits for your target audience. Here’s a polished version for your website audit tool:

### **The Problem**

* Many businesses, particularly small to medium-sized ones, struggle with websites that are not optimized for search engine optimization (SEO), performance, security, or user experience (UX).  
* These issues result in lost traffic, poor user engagement, and reduced revenue.
